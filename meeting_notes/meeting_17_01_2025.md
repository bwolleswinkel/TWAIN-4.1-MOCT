## Attendees
- Bart Wolleswinkel
- Wolfram Martens
## Software management/repository
- Should we continue using Github? or use Gitlab (tudelft)?
    - Comment Riccardo: DTU gitlab?
- What are options to reveal only "mature enough" code? (hidden branches etc.)
- For now, we find it attractive to maintain code and documentation at the same location (currently this repo)
- Maybe use confluence for documentation?
## Software design
- Software design document (SDD) can be found [here](../docs/software_design.md)
- It is a first-shot proposal for software documentation
- It is intended to help us
    - maintain clean structure while developing
    - communicate internally and with other TWAIN parties
- it might be useful to add design diagrams for different levels of abstraction
    - high-level: reveals only the inputs and outputs w.r.t. external parties
    - medium-level: reveals software layers and components, and data flow between components (like [current design diagram](../docs/architecture_layers.png))
    - detailed-level: The optimization component needs to be broken down (reveal surrogate models, cost functions,...)
- Technical details:
    - "Presentation" level:
        - API and/or CLI missing
        - either add them explicitly, or leave "user interface" component entirely generic
## Functional details and requirements
- Optimization parameters
    - It is unclear which parameters are
        - user-specified
        - decision (optimization) variables
        - to be loaded from the database
    - This will need to be clarified with other TWAIN parties
    - Eventually, the toolbox should be flexible about this
        - Example: windfarm layout could be fixed (i.e. specified as user-input, e.g. for existing wind farm), or a variable to be optimized (e.g. for a prospective windfarm)
- Usage scenarios
    - Consider different use-cases/scenarios for the toolbox to clarify/deduct requirements (e.g. previous point about parameter specification)
## Next steps
### Software management/repository
- Clarify what platform we use (Github, Gitlab ...?)
- Explore functionality to hide branches etc.
- (low priority) Look into using confluence for documentation

### Software design
- Continue with the [current SDD](../docs/software_design.md), fill in more details.
### Code implementation
- Begin adding code (dummy components to start with) to test/demonstrate interfaces etc.
- Try to keep the documentation up-to-date
### Usage scenarios
- Consider toolbox usage scenarios to distill requirements
### To be clarified with external TWAIN parties
- Which data/variables are
    - user-specified input
    - decision variables
    - provided by the database
- How to make this configurable
- How to incorporate database queries
- What interfaces are expected of the toolbox (GUI, web service, API, CLI, ...)
