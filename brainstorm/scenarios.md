## Here we explain scenarios of different users

# Scenario 1: Alice

Alice is from academia, and is a first-time user. She has just heard of the software through a mention of the TWAIN project from colleagues. She clones the Github repository, opens Jupyter Notebook, and does the following:

1. In a new script, she types:
```
import twain.moct as moct

moct.open()
```
2. A GUI pops up, which looks something like this:
![gui_alice_draft](images/gui_alice_draft.png)
3. DFd
4. dfd
